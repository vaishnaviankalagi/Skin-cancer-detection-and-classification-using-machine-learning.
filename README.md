# Skin-cancer-detection-and-classification-using-machine-learning.
This project uses machine learning, especially CNN models, to detect and classify skin cancer from dermoscopic images. After preprocessing the data, the model identifies benign and malignant lesions with improved accuracy, helping support early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
